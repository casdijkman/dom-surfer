# Dom Surfer

## About

A javascript library for selecting and operating on document object model (DOM) elements in the browser.
This library is based on the native `document.querySelectorAll()` instead of
[sizzle](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle) in the case of
[jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

Dom Surfer is designed to be a light-weight yet powerful way to interact with DOM elements.
